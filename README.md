Overview:

The purpose of this assignment is to generate a 3D heightmap from a grayscale JPEG image. When the program is run, the name of an image file must be passed as a command line argument.

Building the Application:

Make

Simply navigate to the "hw1-starterCode" folder and type "make." To remove the build directory, type "make clean."

Running the Application:

In order to run the application, a single command line argument (the path to a JPEG file) must be specified when the program is run. By default, the program runs in display mode, which rotates the heightfield about the y-axis. To manually rotate, scale, or translate the mesh, press "tab" to switch to modify mode. The full list of commands are listed below.

a: Triangle Draw Mode: Draws the mesh as grayscale triangles.

b: Wireframe Draw Mode: Draws the mesh as a yellow wireframe.

c: Point Draw Mode: Draws the mesh as a series of purple points.

d: Start animation & Take screenshoot

Control: Translate the mesh in modify mode.

Shift: Scale the mesh in modify mode.

Escape: Terminate the program.
